Contributions of any kind are very welcome in this project, including
new features, bug fixes, or documentation.
Any such contribution **must** be made through a pull request (PR).
Please try to follow the upcoming guardrails to make it easier for the project
maintainers to review and approve your pull requests.
After all, faster reviews benefit everyone!

- In the title of your PR, please use the [gitmoji specification](https://gitmoji.dev/specification).
This makes it easier for us to know what to expect in terms of PR contents.
Also, emojis are just fun!
Please use the *:shortcode:* syntax for emojis, because some of us are working with vim...
- In this repository, PRs are squash merged.
That means, that the individual commits contained in your PR will no longer be visible on the
`main` branch.
It's still preferable to have descriptive commit messages and to try and avoid too many force
pushes to make a reviewer's job easier.
- Finally, please try to provide as much context in the description of your PR as possible.
Why are you making these changes?
What design considerations have you gone through to arrive at your particular solution?
It's a great idea to always keep in mind that someone might come back months later with the
need to change something that was orginally introduced in your PR.

**Thanks for reading all the way through!**

*Feel free to remove this template now and tell us more about your PR - thank you for your contribution!*
