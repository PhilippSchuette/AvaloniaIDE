# AvaloniaIDE

This project contains an Avalonia-based implementation of a customizable, IDE-like
application shell.
It is aiming to provide a shell implementation that is
- fully open source,
- extremely flexible,
- very straightforward to customize,
- with a modern look and feel,
- using up to date technologies from the .NET ecosystem.

All of this is based on [AvaloniaUI](https://avaloniaui.net/) and its awesome
[open source ecosystem](https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/awesome-avalonia).
The *AvaloniaIDE* shell is therefore cross-platform and tested on the Linux, MacOS and
Windows operating systems.

*AvaloniaIDE* is by no means reinventing the wheel:
A bunch of similar projects already exist.
One of the major ones that inspired *AvaloniaIDE* is the amazing
[gemini](https://github.com/tgjones/gemini) IDE framework.
In comparison, *AvaloniaIDE* is a combination of being a research project for personal
education (and fun, of course) as well as a more modern approach - both in terms of
architecture & technologies, but also its approach to UI design and usability.
